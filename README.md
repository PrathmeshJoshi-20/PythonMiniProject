# PythonMiniProject


Store the following details of customers of a bank in a database â€“ Customer name, address, account number, balance and the type of loan he has availed from the bank. 
Write the Python code to retrieve the table contents and count the number of customers who have taken personal loan, education loan, vehicle loan, property mortgage loan and
credit card loan. Also count the number of customers who have not availed any loan.

Assist the bank management to learn the loan trends by using a pie chart to represent the percentage of each count including the count without any loan.
